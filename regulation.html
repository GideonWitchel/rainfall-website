  <p class="medium"><b>Regulatory Pathway</b></p>
  <p class="small"><b class="rainfall">RAInfall</b> will need to be approved by the FDA as a Class III medical device. We have already completed the steps of device discovery and preclinical research prototyping. Now, we will need to fill out a Premarket Approval (PMA) form to get permission to test the safety and efficacy of <b class="rainfall">RAInfall</b>. To do this, we will gather comprehensive evidence from preclinical testing about the benefits to cancer patients and adaptive treatment. Cancer is a widespread issue, so demonstrating impact will not be an issue. The FDA will then inspect our facilities, consult an external panel at a public meeting if necessary, and then decide the status of the PMA.</p>
  <br>
  <p class="small">If we receive a PMA, we will move on to clinical trials. These will begin in simulations and analysis. We will then move to animal testing. After receiving and validating results, we will move onto Phase I human clinical trials, where a small number of cancer patients are monitored with <b class="rainfall">RAInfall</b> and tested for safety impacts. After being approved to move on, we will conduct Phase II human clinical trials, testing for the efficacy of <b class="rainfall">RAInfall</b> in cancer treatment. Finally, we will conduct a broader Phase III of human clinical trials, testing on more patients to ensure reliability. The whole set of trials will be overseen by an independent Institutional Review Board (IRB).</p>
  <br>
  <p class="small">The FDA will then thoroughly review the clinical trial results. If they are approved, <b class="rainfall">RAInfall</b> will go to market.</p>
  <br>
  <p class="small"><b class="rainfall">RAInfall</b> is committed to safety and efficacy. We will continue post-market surveillance and Phase IV clinical trials analysis, both under the FDA and independently. Problems will be reported through MedWatch and fixed.</p>
  <p class="medium"><b>Quality Statement</b></p>
  <p class="small"><b class="rainfall">RAInfall</b> is committed to quality in all aspects of development, manufacturing, and distribution. Cancer treatment is a delicate and complex task; while <b class="rainfall">RAInfall</b>â€™s exploration of new imaging technology has been started, its efficacy at scale has not been proven. <b class="rainfall">RAInfall</b> will prove, implement, test this new technology before ever bringing it to market. We care about the safety of patients and the time of doctors, and we will not jeopardize either. To achieve this goal, <b class="rainfall">RAInfall</b> will follow all FDA current Good Manufacturing Practices, implementing the FDA regulations across all levels of the company. R&D, Manufacturing, Shipping, Labeling, and Management will all work together under Total Quality Management to ensure safety, efficacy, and efficiency across <b class="rainfall">RAInfall</b>. Our documentation practices are rigorous, so any issues are immediately resolved. Additionally, we follow the optional ISO 9000 specification, which demonstrates our unending commitment to quality. We have regular external audits of our systems, and if you have any questions about quality at <b class="rainfall">RAInfall</b>, we will be happy to answer them.</p>
