    <p class="medium"><b>Mission Statement</b></p>
    <p class="medium" style="padding-top: 0"><b class="rainfall">RAInfall</b> exists to make cancer treatment more effective by allowing doctors to monitor the progress of treatment with more granularity.</p>
    <p class="medium"><b>Vision</b></p>
    <p class="medium" style="padding-top: 0">Every doctor will have the tools to adjust cancer treatment to fit every individual’s needs perfectly.</p>
    <p class="medium"><b>Company Profile</b></p>
    <p class="small"><b class="rainfall">RAInfall</b> imaging is a ~50 person R&D, manufacturing, and quality company initially headquartered in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Based on cutting edge research, the goal of this company is to improve radiative cancer treatments with real-time 3D monitoring. We are testing and scaling the prototype developed by Zhang, W., Oraiqat, I., Litzenberg, D. et al. (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-022-01593-8">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-022-01593-8</a>), while ensuring quality. As a biotechnology company, we use novel technology to harness traditionally dangerous radiation to help treat cancer. Since the research is so new, <b class="rainfall">RAInfall</b> imaging is currently investing significant resources into research before starting manufacturing, but this investment will be worthwhile when the technology becomes standard for cancer treatment.</p>
    <p class="medium"><b>Quality Statement</b></p>
    <p class="small"><b class="rainfall">RAInfall</b> is committed to quality in all aspects of development, manufacturing, and distribution. Cancer treatment is a delicate and complex task; while <b class="rainfall">RAInfall</b>’s exploration of new imaging technology has been started, its efficacy at scale has not been proven. <b class="rainfall">RAInfall</b> will prove, implement, test this new technology before ever bringing it to market. We care about the safety of patients and the time of doctors, and we will not jeopardize either. To achieve this goal, <b class="rainfall">RAInfall</b> will follow all FDA current Good Manufacturing Practices, implementing the FDA regulations across all levels of the company. R&D, Manufacturing, Shipping, Labeling, and Management will all work together under Total Quality Management to ensure safety, efficacy, and efficiency across <b class="rainfall">RAInfall</b>. Our documentation practices are rigorous, so any issues are immediately resolved. Additionally, we follow the optional ISO 9000 specification, which demonstrates our unending commitment to quality. We have regular external audits of our systems, and if you have any questions about quality at <b class="rainfall">RAInfall</b>, we will be happy to answer them.</p>
