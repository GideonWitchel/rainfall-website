    <p class="medium"><b>Company Profile</b></p>
    <p class="small"><b class="rainfall">RAInfall</b> is a radiological imaging system for monitoring cancer treatments. The medical device enables complex 3D mapping of the radiation dose, allowing medical professionals to better quantify and adjust radiation dose, enabling the future of adaptive treatment. Since <b class="rainfall">RAInfall</b> is a monitoring system which builds on existing cancer treatments, it does not introduce additional side effects, although there are a litany of severe side effects already associated with cancer treatment. If you are concerned about cancer treatment side effects, you should consult your physician, because they are different for different treatment plans. <b class="rainfall">RAInfall</b> is treatment plan agnostic, as long as the plan involves radiative therapy. <b class="rainfall">RAInfall</b> is not a combination product, with its primary mode of action being a medical device monitoring radiation dosage. Because this device is only to be used by medical professionals in controlled environments, and it has the capacity to be lethal if it inaccurately measures the progress of radiative treatment, it is regulated as a class III device by the FDA.
    </p>
    <p class="medium"><b>iRAI</b></p>
    <p class="small">Ionizing radiation acoustic imaging (iRAI) is a noninvasive imaging technique which uses the radiation emitted during radiological cancer treatment to reconstruct the dosage after it passes through the patient. iRAI can use that data in conjunction with the treatment plan to analyze how much radiation was absorbed by the body. Our advanced system performs this checking in 3 dimensions, constructing a map of radiation absorption for your physician to analyze. This system is a diagnostic tool, but it will allow cancer treatment to be fit to every patient individually, resulting in more effective treatments.</p>
