    <p class="medium"><b>Product Description</b></p>
    <p class="small"><b class="rainfall">RAInfall</b> is a radiological imaging system for monitoring cancer treatments. The medical device enables complex 3D mapping of the radiation dose, allowing medical professionals to better quantify and adjust radiation dose, enabling the future of adaptive treatment. Since <b class="rainfall">RAInfall</b> is a monitoring system which builds on existing cancer treatments, it does not introduce additional side effects, although there are a litany of severe side effects already associated with cancer treatment. If you are concerned about cancer treatment side effects, you should consult your physician, because they are different for different treatment plans. <b class="rainfall">RAInfall</b> is treatment plan agnostic, as long as the plan involves radiative therapy. <b class="rainfall">RAInfall</b> is not a combination product, with its primary mode of action being a medical device monitoring radiation dosage. Because this device is only to be used by medical professionals in controlled environments, and it has the capacity to be lethal if it inaccurately measures the progress of radiative treatment, it is regulated as a class III device by the FDA.</p>
    <p class="medium"><b>Target Demographic</b></p>
    <p class="small"><b class="rainfall">RAInfall</b> is designed for use by all cancer patients receiving radiation therapy. It has been tested on animals, and will be tested on humans. While <b class="rainfall">RAInfall</b> will be mostly marketed for and used on human patients, it could be used for animal patients as well. This technology is needed to enhance existing cancer treatments; more monitoring allows for more adjustment and safer dosage. This technology is also useful for the development of future, highly adaptive, personalized cancer treatments.</p>
